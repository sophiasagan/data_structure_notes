# Linear
# LIFO
# Like a stack of papers on your desk

# Example operations:
#     push(item) - adding an item to the top of the Stacks
#     pop() - removing the item on the top of the stack:; typically returns the item that is removed
#     peek() - returns the value of the item on the top of the stack without removing it

# All stack operations take O(1)time.
